{ ٱحْشُرُواْ } خطاب الله للملائكة ، أو خطاب بعضهم مع بعض { وَأَزْوٰجُهُمْ } وضرباءهم عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم وهم نظراؤهم وأشباههم من العصاة أهل الزنا مع أهل الزنا ، وأهل السرقة مع أهل السرقة . وقيل قرناؤهم من الشياطين . وقيل نساؤهم اللاتي على دينهم { فَٱهْدُوهُمْ } فعرّفوهم طريق النار حتى يسلكوها . هذا تهكم بهم وتوبيخ لهم بالعجر عن التناصر بعد ما كانوا على خلاف ذلك في الدنيا متعاضدين متناصرين { بَلْ هُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ مُسْتَسْلِمُونَ } قد أسلم بعضهم بعضاً وخذله عن عجز ، فكلهم مستسلم غير منتصر . وقرىء « لا تتناصرون » ولا تناصرون ، بالإدغام .

{Gather them} is Allah's address to the angels, or some of them addressing each other. {And their spouses} refers to their peers, as narrated by the Prophet (peace be upon him). They are their equals and those similar to them among the disobedient—adulterers with adulterers, and thieves with thieves. It is also said that they are their partners from the devils. And it is said that they are their women who follow their religion. {So guide them} means to show them the path to the fire so that they may follow it. This is a mockery and rebuke to them for their inability to support each other, after they had been allies and supporters in the world. {But today they are submissive} means that they have surrendered to each other and abandoned each other due to weakness, so all of them are submissive and not victorious. It is also recited as "Do not support each other" and "Do not help each other," with assimilation.
